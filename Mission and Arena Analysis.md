Arena:
The arena for ISRO robotics challenge URSC-2024 is:-
1.	Size of arena: 5m x 10m
2.	Filling material of arena: M-sand
3.  Sloped terrain: A sloped terrain with inclination of 15‚Å∞ and inclined length of 2 m filled with M-sand and distributed with obstacles and craters.
4.  Obstacles: Cubes of sides 150 and 300 mm. The obstacles will be made from wood and planted firmly in the Arena. The rover traversal over them will not disturb their position.
5.  Craters: Craters are created by scooping out sand from the arena. These craters will be
    approximately hemispheres with diameter 200 and 400 mm.
6.  Boundaries of the arena will be marked distinctly.
7.  The starting point (SP) is a 1200mm x 1200mm square block at the corner.
8.  The way point is the point from where the rover will identify and pick up the test tube, it will be 1100mm x 1100mm.
9.  The target point (FP) is located in a 1500mm diameter circle, this is where the sample container will be located, in which we need to put the sample test tube.
10. The sample test tube is of red colour and has the following dimensions: OD=80mm, ID=70mm, Length=125mm, Mass=200gm (+-10gm error).
11. The Sample container is of blue colour with the following Dimensions: ID=150mm, Length=150mm.

Rover and Manupilator (Arm) requirments:
1. The robot should not be connected to any GPS or such external navigation systems to simulate the extraterrestrial conditions.
2. The Robot may use Radio Frequency to communicate in order to control the robot. The range of the radio frequency must be 15m-20m minimum, 25m is the maximum that the rover will go away from the controller.
3. A legal radio frequency must be used to control the robot.
4. The battery pack must survive the whole of the mission time without any replacement.
5. All rovers must be equiped with a big and visible kill switch which must draw out all power from the batteries if needed.
6. the speed rang of the rover is fro 1cm/s to 50cm/s.
7. THe rover must be operation in temperatures ranging from 20 degree celsius to 40 degree celsius.
8. Use of readymade robotic kits is not allowed
9. Pwer efficiency will be accounted in the evaluation.

Task:
3.2.1. Overview of the Field Task:
a. Team members will place the rover inside one of the parking areas marked at each entry
points.
b. Rover has to traverse and arrive at the parking area at one of the exit points.
c. The tasks are identified as:
1. Task-1: Autonomous Navigation (mandatory)
2. Task-2: Autonomous Sample pick and drop (mandatory)
3. Task-3: Repeat the Task-1 & Task-2 until all the samples are dropped in the
sample container
4. Task-4: Identification of bonus markers
d. During the task rover must autonomously plan a safe path to:
1. [Task-1a] arrive at sample location
2. [Task-2a] pick the sample
3. [Task-1b] carry the sample to the drop location
4. [Task-2b] drop the sample
5. [Task-3: all 3 samples] repeat steps (1)-(4) for the remaining two samples
6. [Task-1c] arrive at exit location
7. [Task-4: Identification of bonus markers] search for and identify bonus markers
located randomly in the terrain
Knowns:
1. The position coordinates will be provided for
i. sample tubes
ii. container
iii. entry and exit points
iv. photos of traversable obstacles will be shared
Unknowns:
1. The obstacles (Traversable & Non-traversable) and craters (Traversable) will be
randomly distributed. The participants will not be provided with any details
regarding the coordinates of obstacles and craters.
2. Coordinates of the bonus markers placed in the arena will not be provided.
