Arena:
The arena for ISRO robotics challenge URSC-2024 is:-
1.	Size of arena: 5m x 10m
2.	Filling material of arena: M-sand
3.  Sloped terrain: A sloped terrain with inclination of 15‚Å∞ and inclined length of 2 m filled
    with M-sand and distributed with obstacles and craters.
4.  Obstacles: Cubes of sides 150 and 300 mm. The obstacles will be made from wood and
    planted firmly in the Arena. The rover traversal over them will not disturb their position.
5.  Craters: Craters are created by scooping out sand from the arena. These craters will be
    approximately hemispheres with diameter 200 and 400 mm.
6.  Boundaries of the arena will be marked distinctly.
7.  The starting point (SP) is a 1200mm x 1200mm square block at the corner.
8.  The way point is the point from where the rover will identify and pick up the test tube, it will be 1100mm x 1100mm.
9.  The target point (FP) is located in a 1500mm diameter circle.
10. There are 2 types of craters, 200m diameter and 400mm diameter.
11. There are 2 types of obstacles, cubes of 150mm side and cubes of 300mm side.
