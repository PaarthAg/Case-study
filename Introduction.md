ISRO wants to progress into the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning and space robotics as it looks forward to its ISRO in-orbit servicer mission, Lunar sample return mission, space docking mission, etc..All of these steps are natural after the succes found by the Chandrayan 3 mission. As a plan for further progress ISRO had decided to launch the ISRO robotics challenge 2024 where they motivate students to give innovative ideas and prototype them which can perform specific tasks in conditions similar to the lunar surface. These solutions to problems faced by the rovers right now have high chances of being implemented by ISRO in their next missions.

The objectives of this challenge are to:-
1. provide a platform for exploring the domain of space robotics.
2. To help the students increase their critical thinking and problem solving skills related to the areas of space robotics.
3. To develop innovatice solutions for the future of ISRO.
